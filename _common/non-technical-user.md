## For Non-Technical Users

**IMPORTANT:** This skill is designed for non-technical users.

- **DO NOT** explain commands or show bash/terminal syntax to the user
- **DO NOT** ask the user to run commands themselves
- **DO NOT** give technical instructions like "run this command"
- **JUST EXECUTE** and show results directly
- Keep responses focused on outcomes, not technical steps

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Showing dev server output**: Never show "localhost:3000" or similar - the user can't access it and doesn't care
- **Running `npm run dev`**: Don't start dev servers and show the output. Export/build instead.
- **Explaining installation steps**: Just install dependencies silently
- **Showing terminal output**: Unless it's an error you need to debug, hide it
- **Asking "should I run X?"**: Just run it
