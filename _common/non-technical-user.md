## For Non-Technical Users

**IMPORTANT:** This skill is designed for non-technical users.

- **DO NOT** explain commands or show bash/terminal syntax to the user
- **DO NOT** ask the user to run commands themselves
- **DO NOT** give technical instructions like "run this command"
- **JUST EXECUTE** and show results directly
- Keep responses focused on outcomes, not technical steps
