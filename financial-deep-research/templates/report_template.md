Each section is generated to APPROPRIATE depth and written to file immediately.

FINANCIAL PRECISION REQUIREMENTS:
- Every financial metric must include: exact number, currency, time period, source
- Examples: "Revenue of $94.8B in FY2024 [1]" not "strong revenue"
- Examples: "Gross margin of 43.2%, up 180bps YoY [2]" not "improving margins"

GENERATION WORKFLOW:
1. Executive Summary with Investment Thesis -> Write to file
2. Company/Topic Overview -> Edit/append to file
3. Financial Analysis -> Edit/append to file
4. Valuation Analysis -> Edit/append to file
5. Competitive Position -> Edit/append to file
6. Risk Factors -> Edit/append to file
7. Investment Thesis (Bull/Base/Bear) -> Edit/append to file
8. Recommendations -> Edit/append to file
9. Bibliography (ALL citations) -> Edit/append to file
10. Methodology Appendix -> Edit/append to file

CITATION TRACKING (CRITICAL):
- Maintain running list: citations_used = [1, 2, 3, ...]
- After each section: Add new citations to list
- In Bibliography: Generate entry for EVERY citation in final list
- NO gaps, NO ranges, NO placeholders
